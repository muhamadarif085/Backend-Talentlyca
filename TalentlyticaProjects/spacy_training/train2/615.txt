Researcher November 2020 e Researched about sulfur dioxide as the main cause of acid rain resulting from burning sulfur
containing fuels such as coalfired steam power plants so find the best absorbent composition
that can absorb sulfur dioxide e One of the study said element Cu is effective for absorbing sulfur dioxide gas e The research was carried out in a laboratory with a tools set so that the data obtained were
processed using Microsoft Excel e The results showed that the highest percentage of sulfur dioxide gas absorption occurred at the
Cu content of 20wt and the greater amount of adsorbent the greater absorption that occurs
