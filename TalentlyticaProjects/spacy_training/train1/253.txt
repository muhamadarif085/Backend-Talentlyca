Corner Patch for ADSB Receiver on Cubesat 2020 httpwwwwarseorgIJATCSEstaticpdffile ijatcse37915sl2020pdf Automatic dependent surveillancebroadcast ADSB is an advanced
technology for air traffic monitoring Using frequency of 1090 MHz ADS
B transponder transmit aircraft identity altitude speed position and
other information periodically to ground station Nanosatellite
Laboratory of Telkom University develops TelUSat 2 a CubeSat with
ADSB signal receiver as the mission in purpose to expand the scope of
its signal reception This paper presents a rectangular truncated corner
microstrip antenna for ADSB receiver on a nanosatellite with center
frequency of 1090 MHz Voltage Standing Wave Ratio VSWR 115 with
bandwidth of 115 MHz in the frequency range of 1086 10975 MHz
unidirectional radiation pattern circular polarization with axial ratio 289 dB antenna gain 422 dBi and able to receive ADSB signals from
aircraft with furthest detected distances of 32017 Km ADSB Microstrip Antenna Receiver Design for Cubesat with
Slot 2019  Nanosatellite is one of several satellite classes that have a size that
generally refers to the standardization of cubesat which is 10x10x10 cm
3 Nowadays nanosatellite is widely developed for various purposes
such as air traffic monitoring using Automatic Dependent Surveillance
Broadcast ADSB receiver as the mission Telkom University and the
nanosatellite Laboratory are researching ADSB on nanosatellite The
nanosatellite uses a frequency of 1090 MHz which functions as ADSB
receiver and air traffic control as the primary mission This paper
presents a microstrip antenna design for nanosatellite with the mission
as ADSB signals receiver the antenna has voltage standing wave ratio
VSWR 19 in the frequency of 1090 MHz Then have unidirectional as
the radiation pattern and right hand circular polarization RHCP as the
polarization gain 102 dB 52 MHz bandwidth and range is 189 km An Investigation of RTOS Based Sensor Data Management
Performance for Tel USat On Board Data Handling OBDH
Subsystem 2019  Nanosatellite is one of satellite technology that can now be developed
by various types of circles one of which is in university scaled Currently
Telkom University is developing nanosatellite for research purpose
Nanosatellite system can be run with the support of several subsystems
One of the subsystems is On Board Data Handling OBDH as the main
control The presence OBDH subsystem is for processing system data
such as get the housekeeping data parameters to monitoring and
determine the nanosatellite health system The parameters consist of
temperature gyroscope orientation and magnetic sensing In TelUSat
the On Board Data Handling by using 32bit ARM Cortex M3 as main
controller with several sensors to collect the parameters data To
support the running of reliable system process Real Time Operating
System RTOS can be applied to manage a lot of tasks with the concept
of multitasking and fast processing time
